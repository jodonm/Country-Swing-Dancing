# Country-Swing-Dancing
This app shows a map of places I've been that have a good country swing dancing and/or line dancing crowd.

This app runs in streamlit and has limited functionality. I've redeveloped this application using Django. You can visit the Django website at https://find-country-swing.com, or you can view the source code at https://github.com/jodonm/Find-Country-Swing.

The original streamlit version can be accessed here: https://country-swing-dancing.streamlit.app/
